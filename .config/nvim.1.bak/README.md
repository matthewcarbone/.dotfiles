# Neovim config

Note that basically everything here is based off of
the excellent youtube video by Josean Martinez, found
here: https://youtu.be/vdn_pKJUda8?si=cuD9lIbYr4HFqkEX

NOTE: you left off at about 55 minutes in the video.

NOTE: [this](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config/blob/17d2e3ab3ec6daa7e58902f17a68b0d92e6c374f/viml_conf/options.vim#L13) is a great reference for vim configurations.
