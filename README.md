# Matthew Carbone's `.dotfiles`

- Managed by `stow` (`brew install stow`). See [here](https://systemcrafters.net/managing-your-dotfiles/using-gnu-stow/) for a good introduction and links to the documentation.
- Quick note: make sure that the directory structure in `~/.dotfiles` matches exactly the paths that you want symlinks to be created to starting from your home directory.
- Inspired by the awesome setup by [tcmmichaelb139](https://github.com/tcmmichaelb139/.dotfiles).

# List of dotfiles
